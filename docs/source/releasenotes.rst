Release notes
=============


Version 0.8.2
-------------

The Eskapade patch release v0.8.2 and corresponding docker containers fix two issues:
 
* The ``matplotlib`` backend is no longer set to batchmode when running Eskapade in a jupyter notebook.
  By default, batch mode is only turned on when no DISPLAY environment variable is set, and when not running in a notebook;
  the batch-mode flag can also be controlled with the command line option ``â€“batch-mode``.
 
* The Eskapade docker containers contain working version of ``Eskapade``, ``Eskapade-ROOT``, and ``Eskapade-Spark``. Type:
 
  .. code-block:: bash

    $ docker pull kave/eskapade-usr:0.8.2
 
  to pull it in.


Version 0.8
-----------

In version 0.8 of Eskapade (August 2018) the modules ``root-analysis`` and ``spark-analysis`` have been split off
into separate packages called `Eskapade-ROOT <http://eskapade-root.readthedocs.io>`_ and `Eskapade-Spark <http://eskapade-spark.readthedocs.io>`_ .

So the (core) Eskapade package no longer depends on ROOT and Spark, just on plain python packages.
This make it much easier for people to try out the core functionality of Eskapade.

* To install Eskapade-ROOT and Eskapade-Spark, do:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install Eskapade-ROOT
    $ pip install Eskapade-Spark

  or check out the code from out github repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/KaveIO/Eskapade-ROOT.git eskapade-root
    $ pip install -e eskapade-root/
    $ git clone https://github.com/KaveIO/Eskapade-Spark.git eskapade-spark
    $ pip install -e eskapade-spark/

  where in this example the code is installed in edit mode (option -e).

  You can now use these in Python with:

  .. code-block:: python

    import eskapadespark
    import esroofit


Version 0.7
-----------

Version 0.7 of Eskapade (February 2018) contains several major updates:

* The Eskapade code has been made pip friendly. One can now simply do:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install Eskapade

  or check out the code from out github repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/KaveIO/Eskapade.git
    $ pip install -e Eskapade/

  where in this example the code is installed in edit mode (option -e).

  You can now use Eskapade in Python with:

  .. code-block:: python

    import eskapade

  This change has resulted in some restructuring of the python directories, making the overall structure more transparent:
  all python code, including the tutorials, now fall under the (single) ``python/`` directory.
  Additionally, thanks to the pip convention, our prior dependence on environment variables (``$ESKAPADE``)
  has now been fully stripped out of the code.
* There has been a cleanup of the core code, removing obsolete code and making it better maintainable.
  This has resulted in a (small) change in the api of the process manager, adding chains, and using the logger.
  All tutorials and example macro files have been updated accordingly.
  See the `migration section <misc.html#from-version-0-6-to-0-7>`_ for detailed tips on migrating existing Eskapade code to version 0.7.
* All eskapade commands now start with the prefix ``eskapade_``. All tutorials have been updated accordingly. We have the commands:

  - ``eskapade_bootstrap``, for creating a new Eskapade analysis project. See this new `tutorial <tutorials.html#tutorial-4-creating-a-new-analysis-project>`_ for all the details.
  - ``eskapade_run``, for running the Eskapade macros.
  - ``eskapade_trail``, for running the Eskapade unit and integration tests.
  - ``eskapade_generate_link``, ``eskapade_generate_macro``, ``eskapade_generate_notebook``, for generating a new link, macro, or Jupyter notebook respectively.

Version 0.6
-----------

The primary feature of version 0.6 (August 2017) is the inclusion of Spark, but this version
also includes several other new features and analyses.

We include multiple Spark links and 10 Spark examples on:

* The configuration of Spark, reading, writing and converting Spark dataframes, applying functions and queries to dataframes,
  filling histograms and (very useful!) applying arbitrary functions (e.g. pandas) to groupby calls.

In addition we hade added:

* A ROOT analysis for studying and quantifying between sets of (non-)categorical and observables.
  This is useful for finding outliers in arbitrary datasets (e.g. surveys), and we include a tutorial of how to do this.
* A ROOT analysis on predictive maintenance that decomposes a distribution of time difference between malfunctions
  by fitting this multiple Weibull distributions.
* New flexible features to create and chain analysis reports with several analysis and visualization links.

Version 0.5
-----------

Our 0.5 release (May 2017) contains multiple new features, in particular:

* Support for ROOT, including multiple examples on using data analysis, fitting and simulation examples using RooFit.
* Histogram conversion and filling support, using ROOT, numpy, Histogrammar and Eskapade-internal histograms.
* Automated data-quality fixes for buggy columns datasets, including data type fixing and NaN conversion.
* New visualization utilities, e.g. plotting multiple types of (non-linear) correlation matrices and dendograms.
* And most importantly, many new and interesting example macros illustrating the new features above!

Version 0.4
-----------

In our 0.4 release (Feb 2017) we are releasing the core code to run the framework. It is written in python 3.
Anyone can use this to learn Eskapade, build data analyses with the link-chain methodology,
and start experiencing its advantages.

The focus of the provided documentation is on constructing a data analysis setup in Eskapade.
Machine learning interfaces will be included in an upcoming release.
